Hobby Hacks Submission 2020

Welcome to Peach Jams!
=================

Do you admire music and art? You’re at the right place! With Peach Jams you can add your flavour and customize your music album colours and add your twist to it! Easy and accessible at your service.

During COVID-19, we noticed many people posting about their favorite songs and proudly sharing their music albums on social media. All of these posts from people around the world inspired us to create a website that allows users to customize their own album covers. We hope to provide young adolescents and anyone who enjoys music the opportunity to show off their spirit with their favourite albums with a twist of their personality and creativity. 


### What it does:
Peach Jams is a web application that allows users to upload any image and transform it into an album cover, personalize it with different filters, and download it straight to their computer.

### Languages and Libraries used:
We used JavaScript, HTML, CSS and the p5.js and Caman.js libraries. Initially, the project was hosted in Glitch for live testing and collaboration purposes.
